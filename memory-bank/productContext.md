# Product Context: Momento Seguros - Integration Tests

## 1. Problem
The Momento Seguros platform requires a robust testing strategy to prevent regressions and ensure a high-quality user experience. Manual testing is time-consuming and prone to error, making it difficult to maintain a rapid development pace while ensuring reliability.

## 2. Solution
This project implements an automated end-to-end testing suite using Playwright. These tests will simulate real user interactions with the platform, verifying that critical workflows function as expected. By automating this process, we can detect issues early, reduce manual testing efforts, and increase confidence in deployments.

## 3. User Experience Goals
The integration tests should validate that the user experience is:
- **Seamless:** Users can complete key tasks, like getting an insurance quote, without encountering errors or unexpected behavior.
- **Consistent:** The UI and functionality remain consistent across different browsers and devices.
- **Reliable:** The platform is stable and performs as expected under normal usage conditions.
