# Active Context: Momento Seguros - Integration Tests

## 1. Current Work Focus
The current focus is on initializing the project's memory bank. This involves creating the core documentation files that will guide future development and maintenance of the test suite.

## 2. Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project's goals and scope.
- Created `productContext.md` to outline the problem, solution, and user experience goals.
- Created `systemPatterns.md` to document the testing architecture and key technical decisions.
- Created `techContext.md` to describe the technology stack and development setup.

## 3. Next Steps
- Create `progress.md` to track the project's status.
- Begin implementing the Page Object Model (POM) by creating page objects for the quoting wizard.
- Flesh out the tests in `tests/wizard.spec.ts` to cover the entire quoting workflow.

## 4. Active Decisions and Considerations
- The initial set of memory bank files will establish a baseline for the project. They will be updated as the project evolves.
- The decision to use the Page Object Model will influence the structure of the test suite going forward.
